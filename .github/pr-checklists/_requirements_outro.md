Universal recommendations:
- Make sure your code follows [General Requirements](https://kottans.org/documentation/docs/doc/code-review/#general-requirements) 
- Use common sense or seek for an advice whenever requirements look ambiguous or unclear. 
- Pay more attention to code style - descriptive variable names, indentations, empty spaces, etc. Code should look good :)
