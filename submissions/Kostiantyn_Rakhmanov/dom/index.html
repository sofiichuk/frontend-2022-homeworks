                        Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A. is an Italian luxury car manufacturer
                        and a subsidiary of Stellantis. The company was founded on 24 June 1910, in Milan, Italy. "Alfa"
                        is an acronym of its founding name, "Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili." "Anonima" means
                        "anonymous", which was a legal form of company at the time, as it was founded by anonymous
                        investors. In the initial set-up phase, in order to have a building to produce cars, the company
                        bought the Portello factory building of Darracq in Milan, which was closing up and selling all
                        its assets. The brand is known for sport-oriented vehicles and has been involved in car racing
                        since 1911. Alfa Romeo
                        was owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the company that was responsible for the production of
                        Alfa Romeo cars until its operations were fully merged with those of the PSA Group to form
                        Stellantis on 16 January 2021.
